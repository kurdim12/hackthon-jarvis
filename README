# AI Security Platform - Hackathon Submission

## Project Overview

An integrated AI security platform that combines face recognition authentication with J.A.R.V.I.S. multi-agent capabilities. This system addresses both hackathon requirements by implementing a secure authentication gateway that unlocks access to an intelligent AI assistant.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of two integrated components:

### 1. Face Recognition Authentication System
- Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV
- Excel-based user management system
- Secure authentication flow with confidence scoring
- Failed attempt monitoring and IP blocking
- Comprehensive audit logging and security features

### 2. J.A.R.V.I.S. Multi-Agent AI Assistant
- OpenAI-powered conversational interface
- Multi-agent reasoning engine for complex task planning
- Task decomposition and sequential execution
- Tool integration for weather, search, and calculations
- Voice synthesis capabilities
- Real-time chat interface with conversation memory

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Face recognition with confidence thresholds
- **Multi-Agent Planning**: Break down complex requests into executable steps
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant face recognition and AI responses
- **Professional Interface**: Bootstrap-based responsive web design
- **Admin Dashboard**: System monitoring and authentication statistics
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security and activity logging
- **Voice Synthesis**: Text-to-speech for natural interaction
- **Session Management**: Secure user sessions across both systems

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Flask**: Web framework and API server
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and face recognition
- **OpenAI API**: GPT integration for AI assistant
- **Pandas**: Data processing for user management
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities

### Frontend
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive UI framework
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality
- **WebSocket**: Real-time chat communication
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern web standards

### Data Processing
- **Excel Integration**: User permissions and management
- **Image Processing**: Face detection and encoding
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and security

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Webcam or image upload capability

### Dependencies Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Dependencies
```
flask==2.3.3
opencv-python==4.8.1.78
face-recognition==1.3.0
openai==1.3.0
pandas==2.0.3
openpyxl==3.1.2
scikit-learn==1.3.2
numpy==1.24.3
pillow==10.0.1
requests==2.31.0
gtts==2.4.0
flask-socketio==5.3.6
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### Running the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Authentication Flow
1. Navigate to the upload page
2. Upload a clear photo of your face
3. System processes the image for face recognition
4. Receive authentication result (granted/denied/not found)
5. Successful authentication unlocks J.A.R.V.I.S. interface

### J.A.R.V.I.S. Interaction
1. Access the AI assistant after authentication
2. Type complex requests or questions
3. Watch the system break down tasks into steps
4. Receive comprehensive responses with voice synthesis
5. Continue conversations with memory persistence

### Admin Functions
1. Monitor authentication statistics
2. View security logs and failed attempts
3. Manage user permissions
4. Track system performance metrics

## Model Training

The face recognition system supports training on custom datasets:

1. **Data Preparation**: Organize face images with user IDs
2. **Excel Setup**: Create user permissions file
3. **Training Process**: Use 70/30 train/validation split
4. **Model Evaluation**: Generate performance metrics
5. **Deployment**: Update live recognition system
